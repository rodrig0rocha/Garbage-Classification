# Overview
This project addresses the critical challenge of waste management and recycling by utilizing deep learning techniques to automate the sorting of household garbage. Manual sorting is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors that can contaminate recyclable materials, compromising their usability and overall recycling effectiveness. I leverage advanced artificial intelligence to accurately classify and segregate different types of waste, significantly improving sorting efficiency and reducing the reliance on manual labor. By enhancing the accuracy of waste classification, this approach not only streamlines the recycling process but also supports environmental sustainability by ensuring a higher percentage of materials are correctly recycled and diverted from landfills.
